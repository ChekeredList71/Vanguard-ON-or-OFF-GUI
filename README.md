## Vanguard ON or OFF Java GUI program

This is a GUI app made for controlling Vanguard. It's a fancy interface for running commands to stop, disable or enable it.

## Support

Obviously only works on Windows. If your Command Prompt language is not English, the app will fail to check the status of the Vanguard service.
